         <p id="P1">Hello,
                    I am Gagandeep Singh. I needed to present myself and let you in on a tad about myself. 
                    I'm an ongoing alumni from Queens College with my Bachelor's certification. I'm a viable 
                    understudy focused on getting the hang of, creating abilities in web improvement and group 
                    commitment. I'm independent and enthusiastic with predominant execution in both independent 
                    or cooperative conditions working freely and teaming up with others on bunch projects. I'm 
                    ideal for this position since I love to learn and help other people learn. Right now, 
                    I'm working with figuring out how to create React and TypeScript projects.

            <p id="P2"> On my last undertaking, I made an application which upheld distance-remote learning for 
            understudies. I utilized Html, Css, Node.js and Express, and mySql and mongoose db. Clients can sign
             in and log out, I coordinated client auth utilizing visa to make tireless logins. The two clients, 
             understudy and educators have various entrances. Understudies can sign up for class by mentioning 
             the instructors, and are possibly selected assuming the educator acknowledges their solicitations.
             Understudies can then see every one of the tasks allocated by the instructors. They can present their
              works to those educators and furthermore view every one of the grades. Understudies can likewise see
               announcements made by the instructors too. Educators can select understudies and eliminate them if 
               necessary. They can make new classes and new timetables for the understudies. they can likewise 
               relegate tasks to the entire class and can then grade every one of the tasks. they can likewise 
               leave announcements for the understudies.

            I joined a DevPath Hackathon where my group and I were put first position. We made a web application 
            in response and an android application in java called Parkout. Park Out is an easy to understand 
            site/application which permits any client the capacity to find an accessible parking space close 
            to their area utilizing the enrolled parking spaces. This is done as such by the restricting client 
            who has saved a parking space for the showing up client.
